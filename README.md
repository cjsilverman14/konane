How to run the code:

1. Run the Controller class with no arguments
2. The first question it will ask is how deep the search should check. We were able to successfully get 5 levels deep working at the time of writing this ReadMe. Any deeper caused memory errors
3. The next question it will ask is what color THE AI is. If you put 'B' it will go first
4. The next question will either ask you to put a column number or a direction. If you answered W before, it will ask for a column number. The black pieces run in a downward sloping diagonal line across the board, so the column and row numbers are the same. If you answered B before, it will ask for a direction relative to the removed piece by the AI
5. After this, the game will begin. To enter a move, just enter the starting column, starting row, ending column, and ending row of your move in that order
